About
---
I am currently an Research Engineer at [Neowiz](https://www.neowiz.com/), a leading company in South Korea known for developing AAA games.

I received my master's degree in Computer Science from Chung-Ang University in Korea, where I had the opportunity to work in Professor [Jaesung Lee](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=WgfyWHkAAAAJ&hl=ko)'s [AutoML Lab](http://ml.cau.ac.kr/). During my time there, I gained extensive experience in applying machine learning across a variety of fields including 3D medical imaging, audio signal processing, and humanities research.

Following my graduation, I was fortunate enough to serve my military duty as a Technical Research Personnel in the industry. This allowed me to work at Neowiz, where I engaged in projects integrating AI into game content creation, including 3D character animation, SFX(Sound Effects), and content QC(Quality Control) for AAA games. These invaluable experiences in the gaming industry have deeply fueled my passion for the field of computer graphics.

My research interests lie in **Inverse Rendering**, **Physically-Based Rendering**, and **Neural Material Representation**.
